# PythonIntro

Welcome to the Python tutorial for the bachelors at Cognitive Science! This github is a work-in-progress, so any feedback or contributions are very welcome! If you have feedback or contributions, send me an email at werling1407@gmail.com

## Requirements for the guides

The guide will be using Jupyter Notebooks. These are automatically installed by using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). 

## Getting Started with Python

This notebook introduces basic Python syntax, specifically aimed at students coming from other programming languages such as R.

## Intro to Neural Networks

This notebook builds upon an exam-project for "Introduction to Scientific Programming" course at Aarhus University. This notebook is specifically designed for a workshop for Bachelor students, introducing how linear algebra ties in with data science in Python.
