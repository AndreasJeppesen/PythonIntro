    "The goal in this session is to train a neural network classifier on the MNIST image data (which is the usual \"hello world\" machine learning example). The MNIST data consist of handwritten digits (manually classified) and we want to train the neural network to automatically label these digits for us. In this project we will not be using fancy (i.e. normal) libraries like NumPy so we have to make the functions for everything (e.g. linear algebra) ourselves. Because 3 hours is not quite sufficient to get us all the way we have picked out key functions for you to make and besides this we will be relying on functions that we have created. "
